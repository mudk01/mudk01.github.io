      Like many other students, I am unsure of what to focus on after graduating. Many of my friends have gotten software engineering internships and have even been offered jobs once they graduate. 
      But I honestly don't know if that's for me. I hope to obtain a software engineering internship this upcoming summer to see if that's what I want to do, but for now, I am exploring web development. 
      Web development has been an interest of mine since I took <strong>CSC 131-Computer Software Engineering</strong>. The semster project we worked on kind of ignited a spark and 
      I have been motivated to better my web development skills. For the project, we used <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>express</strong> for the backend of our application and I have really enjoyed using them. 
      I work at <strong>Caltrans</strong> as a part time student assistant and I am utilizing both <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>express</strong> for a web application I am currently developing. A resource that 
      has been extremely helpful is the <a href ='https://nodejs.org/api/' title='Node.js docs' target='_blank'><strong>Node.js documentation</strong></a>. Along with the documentation, <strong>Youtube</strong> videos have
      been a huge help in leanring more about <strong>Node.js</strong>, backend development, and web development in general. I really enjoy backend development but my frontend skills are a bit lacking. 
      Hopeully this class can help me better my skills both in <strong>css</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
